üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Juan Prieto, Making ideas happen into Production env. trough the data-driven solutions.
Mathematician and curious, business oriented.

Making ideas happen into Production env. trough the data-driven solutions.
Obsessed with failing fast and add value through innovation.

Fascinated by AI, Quantum computing, Blockchain, Cloud, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning. View of curiosity and technology as a fundamental engine for the progress of humanity. Passionate about Mathematics. Python believer.

Strong quantitative, problem solving and analytical skills, looking for under way to resolve problems, failing fast, have led me to continually learn and keep up to date on the most relevant IT & Cybersecurity trends. 

Business / Data products involved:

- Operations center workload reduction: 20% reduction of alert analysed. Supervised problem.
- User and entity behaviour analytics: unsupervised anomaly detection based (Isolation Forest, clustering, Fourier Transform, Auto Encoder, Transformers, etc)
- Quantum Machine Learning POC: Classification problem, SVM-based, kernel optimization.
- A/B Testing: Monitoring layer over ML models into Pro.
- COVID19: Health department (JCyL), SIR Model based on ODEs.
- AML/Fraud detection ML tool: Swift international payments fraud detect tool.
- ML Recommender System: Real state application based on Collaborative filtering method.
- Vendors Risk Scoring: Logistic Regression Model based on a Scorecard.
- Forecasting - Operational Losses ML: based on ARIMA Model.
- Clustering ML: Cyber Image Clustering Model based on K-means algorithm.
- Investment Fund Analyzer: Scoring Model based on the KIIDs.
- Deep Learning model: ‚ÄúPneumoscan‚Äù to classify Pneumonia X-Ray images. 
- Vendors RPA: Web Scraping/API ‚Äì Internal and External info. Aggregation.
- Newspaper SaaS: scaled Newsletter with a Sentiment Analysis Model based on NLP / Tokenization. Duplicate and similarity scoring.
- Ad-hoc developments: Python, SQL, pySpark, Scala, Javascript, Java, R to collect, analyse and evaluate large data, drawing logical conclusions and insights. Dashboards, APIs and Web develop framework. Cloud experience: AWS, Azure.
