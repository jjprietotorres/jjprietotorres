üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Juan Prieto, Making ideas happen into Production env. trough the data-driven solutions.
Mathematician and curious, business oriented.

Obsessed with faling fast and add value through innovation.

Fascinated by AI, Quantum computing, Blockchain, Cloud, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning. View of curiosity and technology as a fundamental engine for the progress of humanity. Passionate about Mathematics. Python believer.

Strong quantitative, problem solving and analytical skills, looking for under way to resolve problems, failing fast, have led me to continually learn and keep up to date on the most relevant IT & Cybersecurity trends. 

Deployment of Data/Machine Learning use cases and new business solutions with the full range, from inception, data acquisition, processing, feature engineering, to the AI model, scaled deployment into production and reporting to Senior Management. Cloud experience. Support and oversight of the junior team members. Collaborative projects and experience in stakeholders management: Data, IT & Cyber Risk, Markets, Models, Compliance, Vendors Risk Management, etc. International experience (London, Hong Kong, MX).
